1. Differences between .NET Framework and .NET Core:
Platform Compatibility: .NET Framework is designed to work only on Windows, whereas .NET Core is cross-platform and can run on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
Open Source: .NET Core is open-source, while .NET Framework is not.
Performance: .NET Core generally offers better performance and is more lightweight compared to .NET Framework.
Deployment: .NET Core supports side-by-side versioning, allowing multiple versions to coexist on the same machine. .NET Framework does not support this.
Application Types: .NET Framework is used for desktop applications (Windows Forms, WPF) and ASP.NET web applications. .NET Core is used for web applications, microservices, and console applications.

2. Difference between ASP.NET Core 8 and ASP.NET Core 5 project files, Startup.cs, and Program.cs
Project Files: ASP.NET Core 8 introduces new features and improvements over ASP.NET Core 5, including performance enhancements and native AOT (Ahead-of-Time) compilation.
Startup.cs and Program.cs: In ASP.NET Core 8, the Startup.cs file is often merged into Program.cs to simplify the setup. The CreateHostBuilder method is replaced with CreateBuilder for a more streamlined configuration.

3. Dependency Injection and Different Scopes in ASP.NET Core
Dependency Injection (DI): DI is a design pattern used to achieve Inversion of Control (IoC) between classes and their dependencies. ASP.NET Core has built-in support for DI.
Scopes:
Transient: Services are created each time they are requested.
Singleton: A single instance is created and shared throughout the applicationâ€™s lifetime.
Scoped: Services are created once per request.

4. Routing in ASP.NET Core
Routing: Routing is the process of matching incoming HTTP requests to the appropriate controller actions.
Configuration: Routing can be configured using the UseRouting and UseEndpoints methods in Program.cs.
Convention-based Routing: Defined in Program.cs using route templates.
Attribute-based Routing: Defined directly on controller actions using attributes like [Route].

5. MVC Pattern and Its Advantages
MVC Pattern: Stands for Model-View-Controller. It separates an application into three main components:
Model: Represents the data and business logic.
View: Represents the UI.
Controller: Handles user input and updates the model and view.
Advantages:
Separation of Concerns: Easier to manage and maintain.
Testability: Each component can be tested independently.
Scalability: Supports large-scale applications.

6. Passing Data Between Controller and View
ViewBag: A dynamic object for passing data from controller to view.
ViewData: A dictionary object for passing data.
Models/ViewModels: Strongly-typed objects passed to views.

7. Razor Syntax
Razor Syntax: A markup syntax for embedding .NET code into webpages. It uses @ to transition from HTML to C#.
Benefits: Simplifies the creation of dynamic web content and integrates seamlessly with ASP.NET Core.

8. Model Binding in ASP.NET Core
Model Binding: Automatically maps data from HTTP requests to action method parameters or model properties.
Benefits: Simplifies data handling and reduces boilerplate code.
